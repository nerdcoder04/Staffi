## üîÑ Database Schema

The leave management API uses the following table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leaves (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    emp_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    days INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (days > 0),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING' CHECK (status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED')),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    approved_by UUID REFERENCES hr_users(id),
    approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    rejected_by UUID REFERENCES hr_users(id),
    rejected_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    rejection_reason TEXT,
    blockchain_tx TEXT, -- Stores the blockchain transaction hash
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üß™ Testing

Unit tests for the leave management API are available in:
```
backend/__tests__/leave.test.js
```

Run the tests with:
```bash
npm test -- -t "Leave Management API"
```

## üîó Blockchain Integration

Leave approvals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using the Employee smart contract. The process:

1. When an HR approves a leave request, the system first attempts to record it on the blockchain
2. Only if the blockchain transaction succeeds will the database be updated with approval status
3. The blockchain transaction hash is stored in the `blockchain_tx` field
4. If the blockchain is unavailable or the transaction fails, the leave will not be approved
5. Clear error messages are provided to guide users when blockchain operations fail 

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Leave Management API endpoints in the STAFFI platform. These endpoints handle employee leave requests, approvals, rejections, and returns, with automatic integration with the employee status system and blockchain record-keeping.

## Base URL

All endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.staffi.com/api/leave
```

## Authentication

All HR endpoints require authentication via JWT token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <hr_token>
```

Employee endpoints require employee authentication:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <employee_token>
```

## Leave Status Values

The system supports the following leave request status values:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Leave request is awaiting HR approval |

  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request` - Leave not in APPROVED state or employee not in ON_LEAVE status
- `404 Not Found` - Leave request not found

**Blockchain Integration:**
When an employee returns from leave, the following blockchain transaction occurs:
- The employee status is updated to ACTIVE using `updateEmployeeStatus`

## Employee Status Integration

The Leave Management system is tightly integrated with the Employee Status system:

1. When a leave request is approved, the employee's status is automatically changed to `ON_LEAVE`
2. When an employee returns from leave, their status is automatically changed back to `ACTIVE`
3. All status changes are recorded in the `employee_status_history` table
4. All status changes are also recorded on the blockchain

## Blockchain Integration

All leave-related activities are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability:

1. **Leave Approvals**: When HR approves a leave request, it's recorded on the blockchain using the `recordLeaveApproval` function
2. **Status Changes**: When an employee's status changes to ON_LEAVE or back to ACTIVE, it's recorded using the `updateEmployeeStatus` function

This provides an immutable audit trail of all leave approvals and employee status changes.

## Database Schema

The leave management system uses the following tables:

### Table: `leaves`

| Field        | Type     |
|--------------|----------|
| id           | UUID (PK)|
| emp_id       | UUID (FK)|
| reason       | Text     |
| days         | Int      |
| start_date   | Date     |
| end_date     | Date     |
| status       | Text     |
| submitted_at | Timestamp|
| approved_by  | UUID (FK)|
| approved_at  | Timestamp|
| rejected_by  | UUID (FK)|
| rejected_at  | Timestamp|
| rejection_reason | Text |
| return_date  | Timestamp|
| return_comments | Text  |
| blockchain_tx| Text     |

## Error Handling

All API endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error title",
  "message": "Detailed error message",
  "details": "Additional information (optional)"
}
```
