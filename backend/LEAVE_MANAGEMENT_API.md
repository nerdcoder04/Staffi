## üîÑ Database Schema

The leave management API uses the following table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leaves (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    emp_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    days INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (days > 0),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING' CHECK (status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED')),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    approved_by UUID REFERENCES hr_users(id),
    approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    rejected_by UUID REFERENCES hr_users(id),
    rejected_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    rejection_reason TEXT,
    blockchain_tx TEXT, -- Stores the blockchain transaction hash
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üß™ Testing

Unit tests for the leave management API are available in:
```
backend/__tests__/leave.test.js
```

Run the tests with:
```bash
npm test -- -t "Leave Management API"
```

## üîó Blockchain Integration

Leave approvals are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using the Employee smart contract. The process:

1. When an HR approves a leave request, the system first attempts to record it on the blockchain
2. Only if the blockchain transaction succeeds will the database be updated with approval status
3. The blockchain transaction hash is stored in the `blockchain_tx` field
4. If the blockchain is unavailable or the transaction fails, the leave will not be approved
5. Clear error messages are provided to guide users when blockchain operations fail
